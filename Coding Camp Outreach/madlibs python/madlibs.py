#Mad libs are stories filled with emplty spaces that allow you to make up wacky stories
#You have four options of types of words you can enter, nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs
#Nouns are naming words, person, place, or thing (Cat, Joe, lamp)
#Verbs are action words (ate, swim, sing)
#Adjectives are decsribing words (rainy, spotty, green, huge)
#Adverbs are words that describe verbs (softly, quickly, carefully)
#In this, you will write a story leaving a few words blank, to be filled by users
#You should write your story first, in print lines, and then go back and create variables for some of the blanks
yourName = input("Enter your name")
adjective1 = input("Enter an adjective")
ingWord = input("Enter a word ending in -ing")
name = input("Enter a name")

#now, while you can enter several print lines, you can also use three quotes at the beginning and end 
#of your print function, and it will allow you to type on multiple lines.
print(f"""It was a {adjective1} day, and {yourName} was {ingWord} about the house.
your friend, {name} was with you. Thats all
""")

#My story kinda lame maybe I'll upgrade but that is the gist


#Continue to python day1 part2 to continue with lesson.
