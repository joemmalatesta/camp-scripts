        <div class="about-me">
            <h1>About Me/Favorite Movie</h1>
            <p>This is all about me. Have them write a paragraph about themselves or their fav movie</p>

        <!-- Change the background color and see that it works, but what about if we add another div -->
        <div>
            <h1>My Favorite Sport</h1>
            <p>My favorite sport is soccer. I played for like 10 years</p>
        </div>
        <!-- See now if we use the Div tag again it will have the same style attributes as before -->
        <!-- To change the styles of each divider seperately, we need to use classes. -->
        <!-- Classes are written in the opening div tag and are used to target a single div in your stylesheet -->

            <h1>My favorite show is Hunter x Hunter</h1>
            <p>This is the first anime I watched. I found it from watching ninja.</p>
