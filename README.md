Comprehensive programs used for teaching and creating projects with students for my summer job at Oakland University

## Reason
My job as a Summer Camp Councilor at Oakland University gave me the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people, with their programming knowledge ranging from nothing all the way to those in PHD programs. We worked from May to June creating and testing powerpoints, programs, and modules to help teach our students. From the end of June until August we then taught students from 3rd grade all the way to 12th how to code using our prepared material. While our elementary students mainly learned the basics of programming through making games on scratch and code.org, the programs in this repository were prepared by me for middle and high school students. The code is heavily commented as there is instruction written alongside the code for whoever may be teaching.
## My job
Teaching 500+ students over the course of the summer has given me the opportunity to hone my ability to communicate complex concepts at a fundamental level in order to better help students understand. For exmaple, I learned that students brand new to programming respond better to data types string and int being explained as simply words or numbers. Lots of small simplfications like this has allowed me to teach all levels of students learning at varying rates. 
## Greatful for opportunity
In addition, this job has allowed me to work closely with employees at Ford to collaborate in helping teach some of the Engineering Society of Detroit's students. 
This job, presented to me in my data structures class, has had numerous positives on my life as a whole. From setting my sleep schedule right and making new friends, to strengthening my love and ability in coding and being able to share that with others. My position at Oakland povided a strong first step into a field I'm certain I will reamin.
